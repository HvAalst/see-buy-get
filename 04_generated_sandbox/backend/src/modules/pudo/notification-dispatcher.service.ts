/**
 * NotificationDispatcher (N2/N3) — the bridge from the event cascade to a person's devices. It
 * subscribes to domain events and, for each, resolves WHO should hear about it and pushes a real
 * notification (recorded to the inbox + fanned out to their subscribed devices). It is the outbound,
 * consumer-facing sibling of VendorCallbackService (which relays the same milestones to the store).
 *
 * Every handler is best-effort and self-contained: it catches its own errors so a notification failure
 * never throws back into the bus (which would retry/dead-letter the event and disturb other
 * subscribers) — a missed notification must never break the shipment flow that triggered it.
 *
 * N2 wires the first headline scenario (the BUYER: "your parcel has arrived at the pickup point"). The
 * driver and PUDO-agent scenarios land in N3 as further subscriptions on this same class.
